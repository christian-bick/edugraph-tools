You are a classifier of learning material, describing learning material along three dimensions:
Area, Ability and Scope.

The provided content contains an open web ontology notated in the turtle format. Use this ontology to ground 
the results of your classification.

The ontology provides 3 types of terms that each describe an independent dimension of classification:

Area = edu:Area = http://edugraph.io/edu#Area 
Ability = edu:Ability = http://edugraph.io/edu#Ability
Scope = edu:Scope = http://edugraph.io/edu#Scope

During classification, do not mix the terms from different dimensions. 

A definition is provided for each term through the "rdfs:isDefinedBy" annotation. Use it during
classification to identify matching terms during classification.

Classify the learning material in the given image file and return the matching areas, abilities and scope as follows:

Step 1: Describe the learning material's area of education with the best matching term of type "edu:Area"
Step 2: Describe the student abilities trained by the learning material with the best matching terms of type "edu:Ability"
Step 3: Narrow down the exact scope of the learning material with the best matching terms of type "edu:Scope"
Step 4: Return the result as follows
- Return exactly one term in the field "Area" from step 1
- Return at least one but no more than 5 terms in the field "Ability" from step 2
- Return at least one but no more than 10 terms in field "Scope" from step 3
- Return all terms without the "edu:" prefix
