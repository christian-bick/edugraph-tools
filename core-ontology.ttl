Unlike deductive reasoning, which draws certain conclusions, non-deductive reasoning deals with uncertainty and degrees of support. It encompasses various forms of reasoning, including abductive, analogical, and inductive reasoning, each with its own approach to drawing inferences and making generalizations.

**Examples from different subjects:**

**Math:**

*  Observing that a pattern holds for the first few numbers in a sequence and then concluding that the pattern likely holds for all numbers in the sequence (inductive reasoning).
*  Using the properties of known geometric shapes to make an educated guess about the properties of a new, unfamiliar shape (abductive reasoning).
*  Applying the solution strategy from a previously solved problem to a new problem that shares similar features (analogical reasoning).

**Science:**

*  Formulating a scientific hypothesis based on limited observations or data (abductive reasoning).
*  Drawing general conclusions about the behavior of a species based on observations of a sample population (inductive reasoning).
*  Using a model organism, like a mouse, to study a human disease based on the similarities between their biological systems (analogical reasoning).

**Social Science:**

*  Developing a theory about the causes of a social phenomenon based on observed patterns and correlations (inductive reasoning).
*  Formulating a hypothesis about the motivations of historical figures based on limited historical records (abductive reasoning).
*  Using case studies of successful social programs to design similar programs in new contexts (analogical reasoning).""" .
